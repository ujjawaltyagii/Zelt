# Zelt
- A cool website that I tried to replicate with 3D animations using `canvas`, `ScrollTrigger`, and the `Locomotive library`.
- Hosted using Netlify
- Tech: JavaScript, CSS, HTML
- LIVE Hosted link: [zelt-3d](https://zelt-3d.netlify.app/)

Note: As of now, only the web view is available, so please view it on a larger screen (desktop/laptop)!

work in progress...
